        <p>360 views of the fort today, with a button to see what it might have looked
          like. As historically accurate as possible. An educational purpose.</p>
        <p>Dual rendering for transition between present day and Rome. Need to be
          mindful about performance and motion sickness. Could use <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255980/Portal_Reloaded/">Portal Reloaded</a> time
          portals as inspiration.</p>
        <p><strong>Have 3 months</strong> be careful about scope creep.</p>
        <p>Maybe do “a day in the life”, and go into further detail about one or
          two areas.</p>
        <p>Performance is essential. Most headsets require 90-120fps for two viewports.
          Drivers add reprojection automatically which should only be used as a fallback.</p>
