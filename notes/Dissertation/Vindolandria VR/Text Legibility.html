        <p>Reading in VR is difficult so would need something to help with accessibility.
          Maybe voice over or opening documents on the user's desktop? Could have
          subtitles similar to Half Life Alyx handled them (video with subtitles
          on: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RKPMg5TEWE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RKPMg5TEWE</a>)
          as I remember them being very readable. That is: follow look with some
          minimum value, and high contrast with the scene. Maybe render at a higher
          scale (handled by Steam VR) to further increase quality. TLDR: Large print
          + high contrast.</p>
        <p>If using a voice over, could just use text to speech.</p>
