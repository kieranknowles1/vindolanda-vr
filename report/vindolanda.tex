\subsubsection{Which Engine?}
% TODO: Which Engine}

Multiple engines were considered, each with their own benefits
and drawbacks as summarised in Table \ref{table:engine_compare}

Virtual reality is a significantly more demanding environment than other games.
While 1080p at 60Hz is a common target for flat screens, VR games must render
two screens at 90-120Hz each, with users often upscaling for enhanced clarity.
Consequently, performance is a crucial requirement for any VR game.

Given the short deadline of the project, industry adoption was also a major
consideration based on the assumption that a more widely adopted engine would
have more resources available to reduce development time. The total number of
games tagged as VR, detected as using a specific engine by
SteamDB (\url{https://steamdb.info/tech/}), and released
after May 2023 (to include current trends) were used to determine adoption.
This methodology has its limitations: by only using SteamDB as a source,
selection bias is introduced as non-steam releases such as itch.io and the Meta
Store are excluded. Additionally, SteamDB's engine detection can produce false
negatives, for example, Godot games can be packaged as a single executable which
will not be detected. Despite these limitations, this methodology was considered
good enough to get a high-level overview.
% TODO: Figure for false negative of Godot. Doesn't need to be a VR game

A smaller, but important, consideration was the engine's support for Git version
control. While it would have been possible to install and learn Perforce, doing
so would detract from development time, this made Unreal Engine a less practical
choice as it uses binary files for assets, which Git is poorly suited at
versioning.

Based on this analysis, it was determined that Unity best fits the needs of the
game.

\subsection{The Setting}

While Roman occupation of Britain spanned centuries, it was decided to set this
game during Emperor Hadrian's visit in 122 AD.
\cite[p.176]{danziger_hadrians_2006}, \cite[p.157]{moffat_wall_2009}
This setting gives the opportunity to teach about the rule of Hadrian himself
and the history leading to the construction of Hadrian's Wall, as well as other
events such as the disappearance of the ninth legion circa 120 AD.

\subsection{VR Considerations}
Virtual reality introduces a unique set of challenges to game development. One
of these is motion sickness, especially for users inexperienced with VR,
\cite{chattha_motion_2020} which is often worsened by smooth locomotion, but can
be mitigated by instead using teleport locomotion, although some users may feel
disoriented after teleporting, the majority find it an easy to use movement
method. \cite{bozgeyikli_point_2016} Due to the target audience of this game
being mostly users without prior VR experience, teleport movement was deemed a
higher priority than smooth movement.

% TODO: Mention difficulties in direct testing due to prior experience
% TODO: Could I talk about personal experience? Would need to be clear that it's
% biased by the learning effect: smooth/teleport both ok, but rotation causes
% disorientation

% TODO: Educational Value. What makes a good educational game?


\subsection{Requirement Analysis}
% TODO: Requirement analysis

A requirement analysis using the MoSCoW method (Must-have, Should-have,
Could-have, and Won't-have) was performed to determine functional and
non-functional requirements for the game.

% TODO: Functional requirements}
\subsubsection{Functional requirements}

\paragraph{FR01 Recreate Vindolanda}
The game \textbf{must} include a recreation of Vindolanda during Hadrian's
rule.

\paragraph{FR02 Recreate Hadrian's Wall}
The game \textbf{should} include a recreation of Hadrian's wall during Hadrian's
rule.

\paragraph{FR03 Before and After}
The game \textbf{should} provide past and present representation of locations
with the option to switch between them.

\paragraph{FR04 Teleport Locomotion}
The game \textbf{must} include teleport-based locomotion.

\paragraph{FR05 Smooth Locomotion}
The game \textbf{should} include smooth locomotion.

\paragraph{FR06 Tutorial}
The game \textbf{should} begin with a brief tutorial on how to move around
using the selected locomotion method, and advise them on the motion sickness
they may experience from smooth locomotion.

\subsubsection{Non-functional requirements}

\paragraph{NFR01 Performance}
The game \textbf{must} maintain 90FPS during typical gameplay.

\paragraph{NFR02 Linux Support}
The game \textbf{could} include native Linux support.
