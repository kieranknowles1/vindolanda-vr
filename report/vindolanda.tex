\subsubsection{Which Engine?}
% TODO: Which Engine}

Multiple engines were considered, each with their own benefits
and drawbacks as summarised in Table \ref{table:engine_compare}

Virtual reality is a significantly more demanding environment than other games.
While 1080p at 60Hz is a common target for flat screens, VR games must render
two screens at 90-120Hz each, with users often upscaling for enhanced clarity.
Consequently, performance is a crucial requirement for any VR game.

Given the short deadline of the project, industry adoption was also a major
consideration based on the assumption that a more widely adopted engine would
have more resources available to reduce development time. The total number of
games tagged as VR, detected as using a specific engine by
SteamDB (\url{https://steamdb.info/tech/}), and released
after May 2023 (to include current trends) were used to determine adoption.
This methodology has its limitations: by only using SteamDB as a source,
selection bias is introduced as non-steam releases such as itch.io and the Meta
Store are excluded. Additionally, SteamDB's engine detection can produce false
negatives, for example, Godot games can be packaged as a single executable which
will not be detected. Despite these limitations, this methodology was considered
good enough to get a high-level overview.
% TODO: Figure for false negative of Godot. Doesn't need to be a VR game

A smaller, but important, consideration was the engine's support for Git version
control. While it would have been possible to install and learn Perforce, doing
so would detract from development time, this made Unreal Engine a less practical
choice as it uses binary files for assets, which Git is poorly suited at
versioning.
