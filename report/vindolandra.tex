\subsection{Which Engine?}
\todo{Which Engine}

Multiple engines were considered, each with their own benefits
and drawbacks as summarised in Table \ref{table:engine_compare}

Virtual reality is a significantly more demanding environment than other games.
While 1080p at 60Hz is a common target for flat screens, VR games must render
two screens at 90-120Hz each, with users often upscaling for enhanced clarity.
Consequently, performance is a crucial requirement for any VR game.

Given the short deadline of the project, industry adoption was also a major
consideration based on the assumption that a more widely adopted engine would
have more resources available to reduce development time.

Feature & Unreal & Unity & Godot \\\midrule

Language & C\# & Blueprints, C++ & GDScript, C++, C\#, etc. \\
VR Support & De facto standard & Yes, performance could be a concern & Yes \\
Version Control & Git, text & Perforce, binary & Git, text \\
Linux Support & Yes & Editor unreliable & Yes \\
